# Masters.chat — An AI-Powered Study Companion for Frontend Masters

<AnimatedName />


If you've ever taken a course on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com), you know the feeling: hours of dense, expert-led content covering everything from JavaScript fundamentals to advanced system design. It's one of the best learning platforms out there, and I've spent countless hours learning from it.

But here's the thing — after watching dozens of courses, I'd often find myself thinking, *"I know I learned about this somewhere... but which course was it? And what exactly did the instructor say?"*

That question became the spark for **masters.chat**.

## What is Masters.chat?

Masters.chat is a full-stack AI chat application that lets you ask technical questions and get answers grounded in real Frontend Masters course content. Under the hood, it uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to search through transcript embeddings from Frontend Masters courses and return responses that cite actual instructors, course names, and timestamps.

Think of it as a study buddy that has watched every Frontend Masters course published in the past two years and can recall exactly what was said, by whom, and when.

## Why I Built It

Two reasons, really.

### A Love Letter to Frontend Masters

Frontend Masters has been a massive part of my growth as a developer. The quality of instruction, the depth of topics, and the calibre of instructors — it's genuinely special. I wanted to build something that celebrated that content and made it more accessible in a new way. Not a replacement for watching the courses, but a companion that helps you revisit and connect ideas across them.

### A Playground for AI

I'd been itching to get my hands dirty with AI tooling — not just calling an API and displaying a response, but really understanding the full pipeline: vector embeddings, retrieval strategies, streaming architectures, prompt engineering, and agentic tool use. Masters.chat gave me the perfect excuse to explore all of that in the context of something I actually cared about.

This project was never about building a product or making money. You might notice that the account page mentions "payment coming soon" with a Pro tier — that's there because I wanted to build a realistic, complete application experience as part of the learning process. Designing pricing UI, quota systems, and upgrade flows taught me a lot about product engineering. But the goal was always education and experimentation, not revenue.

## How It Works

### The RAG Pipeline

When you ask a technical question, the app doesn't just send it to an LLM and hope for the best. Here's what actually happens:

1. **Intent Detection** — The agent first determines if your message is a casual greeting or a technical question. Casual messages skip RAG entirely (no need to search a vector database just to say "hello").

2. **Vector Search** — For technical queries, the agent calls a RAG tool that searches an Upstash Vector database containing embeddings from Frontend Masters transcripts. It retrieves the top 10 results by cosine similarity, filters to a minimum relevance score, deduplicates by course, and returns the top 5 most relevant excerpts.

3. **Grounded Response** — The LLM generates its answer using those transcript excerpts as context, citing the instructor and course name. It's instructed to never fabricate course content or make up instructor names.

4. **Streaming** — The response streams to the browser in real time, so you see the answer forming word by word.

### Local-First Architecture

One of the architectural decisions I'm most proud of: **all chat data lives in your browser's IndexedDB by default**. There's no mandatory account, no forced cloud storage. You can use the app anonymously, and your conversations stay on your device.

For users who do sign in, there's an optional bidirectional sync to a Neon Postgres database. The sync uses a smart merge strategy — for each piece of data, whichever version (local or cloud) has the more recent timestamp wins. This means you can use the app across devices without losing anything.

### Auto-Generated Thread Titles

After your first message in a conversation, the app automatically generates a concise two-word title for the thread (like "React Hooks" or "CSS Grid") using a structured output call to GPT-4o. It's a small touch, but it makes navigating your conversation history much more pleasant.

## Tech Stack

Here's what powers the app:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router and React 19
- **Vercel AI SDK** for streaming and agentic tool use
- **Upstash Vector** for transcript embeddings and RAG retrieval
- **Upstash Redis** for rate limiting and message quotas
- **Dexie (IndexedDB)** as the primary local data store with live queries
- **Neon Postgres + Drizzle ORM** for optional cloud sync
- **Clerk** for authentication
- **Zustand** for global state management
- **TanStack Query** for server state
- **Tailwind CSS + Radix UI** for the interface
- **OpenAI and Anthropic** model providers (GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3 Haiku)

The component architecture follows Atomic Design — atoms, molecules, and organisms — with each organism co-locating a custom hook for clean separation between logic and presentation.

## Features Worth Highlighting

- **Multi-model support** — Switch between AI models mid-conversation. Enable or disable models from the settings page based on what you prefer.
- **Global search** — `Cmd+K` opens a search overlay that searches across all thread titles and message content in real time.
- **Personalisation** — Tell the app your name, occupation, and preferences, and the AI tailors its responses accordingly.
- **Message quotas** — Anonymous users get a daily limit; authenticated users get a higher one. All tracked via Redis with 24-hour TTL windows.
- **Rate limiting** — Sliding window rate limits prevent abuse without degrading the experience for normal use.
- **Dark mode** — Full theme support with system preference detection and no flash of unstyled content.
- **Mobile responsive** — Slide-over sidebar, mobile header, touch-friendly interactions.
- **Virtualised message list** — Long conversations stay performant thanks to `virtua`, which only renders visible messages in the DOM.

## It's Not About the Money

I want to be upfront about this: masters.chat was built as a personal project and a learning exercise. The "Pro" upgrade section, pricing cards, and "coming soon" payment references exist because building those features taught me about product design patterns — quota systems, upgrade flows, tiered access. But I have no plans to monetise this.

Frontend Masters is a platform that has given me so much as a developer. This project is my way of paying tribute to that, not profiting from it. The content in the RAG database serves to point users *toward* Frontend Masters courses, not away from them.

## What I Learned

Building masters.chat pushed me into areas I hadn't explored before:

- **RAG is more than a buzzword.** Tuning relevance thresholds, deduplication strategies, and prompt instructions to get actually useful citations took real iteration.
- **Local-first is powerful but tricky.** Bidirectional sync with conflict resolution is genuinely hard. SuperJSON serialisation, Dexie transactions, and careful timestamp comparison made it work.
- **Streaming UX matters.** The difference between waiting 3 seconds for a full response and seeing text appear in real time is enormous for perceived performance.
- **Agentic patterns unlock flexibility.** Having the AI decide *when* to search versus *when* to just respond made the experience feel natural rather than mechanical.
- **Building "complete" features teaches more than prototyping.** Implementing rate limiting, quota tracking, structured logging, error handling with `tryCatch`, and CI/CD taught me more about production engineering than any tutorial.

## Wrapping Up

Masters.chat started as a "what if" and turned into one of the most rewarding projects I've built. It combines two things I care about — the Frontend Masters community and the evolving landscape of AI — into something that's genuinely useful for learning.

If you're a Frontend Masters fan, give it a try. And if you're a developer thinking about building with AI, I hope this project shows that you don't need a business plan to build something meaningful. Sometimes the best projects are the ones you build just because you're curious.
